The Telerik <strong>RadMenu</strong> creates attractive and flexible menus, designed to be easy for users to use, but with the flexibility to include advanced features such as multi-line text, top-level icons, icons above text, and more. The current example demostrates the multiline text capability of <strong>RadMenu.</strong> It is achieved through the <strong>Text</strong> property, where you enter multiline item text. Alternatively, you can set the multiline text programmatically.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/menus-menu-working-with-radmenu-items-multi-line-menu-item-text.html">online documentation</a></p>
