The Telerik <b>RadMenu</b> enables you to implement attractive navigation systems, comprised of classic or Office 2007-style menus. Based on the Telerik Presentation Framework, the component gives you full control over item appearance, orientation, and text-wrapping, while allowing you to easily nest checkboxes, images, or any other controls in design-time.<br>This example demonstrates the power of <strong>RadMenu,</strong> as well as its visual appearance. The menu can be enabled by clicking on one of the images underneath it, similar to Image Photo Gallery in Windows Vista. <p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/menus-menu-overview.html">online documentation</a></p>
