You can nest <strong>RadControls</strong> within <strong>RadMenu.</strong> This feature gives you enormous flexibility in building functionality into applications and allows you to create complex custom user interfaces featuring text boxes, combo boxes, or other custom elements within the menu area. This example demonstrates <strong>RadMenu</strong> with a menu item, which contains a <strong>RadComboBox.</strong> The combobox is actually a <b>RadComboBoxElement,</b> which enables it to inherit its properties from the parent menu item. <b>RadMenuComboItem</b> has a <b>ComboBoxElement</b> property which exposes the combobox instance. As the combobox element takes all available space, its width could be changed by setting the <b>ComboBoxElement.MinSize</b> property.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/menus-menu-working-with-radmenu-items-nesting-controls-in-menu-items.html">online documentation</a></p>
