<strong>RadApplicationMenu</strong> is the Telerik counterpart of the "application menu" introduced with Office 2007 as part of Microsoft’s Ribbon UI. It displays controls used to perform actions on entire documents and forms, such as <i>Save</i> and <i>Print.</i> It also provides a list of recent documents, access to form options, and the ability to exit the form or application. <strong>RadApplicationMenu </strong>replaces the "application menu" that is currently in use in <b>RadRibbonBar</b> for WinForms. As with all Telerik WinForms controls, it comes with intuitive design-time support, many extendability features, and theme support.<br><strong>RadApplicationMenu </strong>is fully compliant with the <i>2007 Microsoft Office Fluent User Interface Design Guidelines</i>.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/menus-application-menu-overview.html">online documentation</a></p>
