While visually blending two objects is possible with GDI+, it is impossible to control the transparency of nested Windows controls. RadControls solve the problem, delivering transparency through alpha-blending and transparency of nested items. The transparency of any <strong>RadItem</strong> is easily controlled via an <strong>Opacity</strong> property that affects text, border, fill, and even SubItems. The <strong>Magnifier</strong> example uses the TPF animation API and is created with just few lines of code. It is composed of many <strong>RadButtonElements</strong> which are arranged in a special magnifier layout. When hovered, the Magnifier control animates the <strong>ScaleTransform</strong> property of each button in its surrounding area.
