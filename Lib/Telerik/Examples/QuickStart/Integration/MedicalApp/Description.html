This demo application demonstrates how the controls in Telerik UI for WinForms can be used in the medical industry, and specifically in scheduling and managing doctor appointments. In the Sample App, you can see examples of quite a few controls with the Chart and Schedule components standing out, but also how a WinForms application can be stylised with a fresh and up-to-date look.
