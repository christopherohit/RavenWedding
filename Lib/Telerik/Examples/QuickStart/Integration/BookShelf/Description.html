This demo application aims to demonstrate the stunning Metro look that you could easily achieve by using Telerik® UI for WinForms. The data is pulled from the Ebay book store and is arranged in the familiar panorama view. It is a reference application, which can be used by bookstores to help customers find the books they are interested in. Searching and grouping is also available.
