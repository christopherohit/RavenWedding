Telerik® UI for WinForms provide an advanced text styling mechanism, which can be applied to all Telerik products, because it enhances the smallest element in the Telerik Presentation Framework - the text primitive. The new rich text formatting mechanism uses plain HTML tags to display formatted text such as font style, font color, fontSystem.Drawing.Size options and simple layouts. <br />To turn on Html-like formatting the text must start with an <strong>&lt;html&gt;</strong> tag; use <strong>&lt;size=[+|-]value&gt;</strong> to set fontSystem.Drawing.Size use, and <strong>&lt;br&gt; </strong>to create new line feed. To bold, underline and italic text, use the corresponding opening and closing tags. Font family is set through <strong>&lt;font=Family&gt;.</strong>
