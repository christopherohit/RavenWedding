The Telerik Hotel Management app for WinForms is a demo application mimicking a hotel reservation system stylized with the Material Theme to represent some of the controls and capabilities the suite has to offer in a real-life scenario. 
<p>We've utilized our Grid, Scheduler, and Charting components, on top of many others in the application and have presented them as examples in the various tabs - Overview, Bookings, Schedule, Housekeeping, and Reporting. You can also switch among the different colors of the Material Theme for your convenience.</p>
