<strong>RadCalendar</strong> supports multi-month rendering by setting the <strong>AllowMultipleView</strong> property to <b>true</b>. You will also need to set the <strong>MultiViewColumns</strong> and <strong>MultiViewRows</strong> properties to the desired values. In this example <b>MultiViewColumns</b> is set to 2 and <b>MultiViewRows</b> to 2.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/calendar-customizing-behavior-customizing-multi-view.html">online documentation</a></p>
