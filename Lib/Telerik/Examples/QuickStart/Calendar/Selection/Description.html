Telerik <strong>RadCalendar</strong> supports single-day and multi-day selection through the <strong>AllowSelect</strong> property (the default value is false). To enable multi-date selection, we set <strong>AllowMultiSelect</strong> to true. The row and column headers, as well as the view selector, can also be used to select multiple dates.
