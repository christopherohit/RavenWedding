<strong>RadCalendar</strong> supports rich navigation settings, including date ranges (min and max date range). This example demonstrates the available navigation options as well the supported navigation properties. The end-user can navigate between months thanks to the navigation buttons, where the regular navigation button navigates by a month and the fast navigation button navigates by a predefined number of months. The end-user can also navigate to the prev/next few months using the popup navigation. And in case the end-user quickly wants to go to another year, or years back/ahead, then he can benefit from the zoom navigation that zooms in/out from month view, through year view and decades view, to a whole century, resembling the behavior of the standard Windows Calendar the end-user is already acquainted with.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/calendar-customizing-behavior-customizing-navigation.html">online documentation</a></p>
