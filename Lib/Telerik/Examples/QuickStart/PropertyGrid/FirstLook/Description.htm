<i>RadPropertyGrid</i> provides an easy and versatile approach to processing data objects' properties. Utilizing its autogeneration features and the intuitive custom editors capabilities, users would be able either to display data in a way that best fits their needs or modify it with minimal effort. It can be bound to an item with just a single line of code and you may start exploring or editing its properties. The proper editor controls are auto generated - text fields for string properties, DateTimePickers for dates, ComboBoxes for enums and Booleans, RadColorPicker for colors. In addition, RadPropertyGrid allows flexible manual setting and customization of editors. This example allows you to modify the properties of a given object and see the result of these modifications.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/propertygrid-overview.html">online documentation</a></p>
