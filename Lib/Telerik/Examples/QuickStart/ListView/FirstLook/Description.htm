<b>RadListView</b> is a component which can display a flat collection of objects in three different ways: as a list, as icons or in a grid-like interface which can show detailed description of each item. RadListView is built over the generic data layer which the RadGridView and RadTreeView use and supports operations such as grouping and sorting. It also uses their virtualization mechanism, which means that it will provide exceptional data-binding and visual performance.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/listview-overview.html">online documentation</a></p>
