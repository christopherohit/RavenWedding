RadDataEntry provides an easy way to display and edit arbitrary business objects in a form layout. The built-in editors are generated by default, so that you can achieve a fully operational CRUD support with a single line of code by simply binding to the business object or to a collection of objects. RadBindingNavigator provides a basic UI for navigation through a collection of business objects as well. Its UI also allows you to add and delete objects. The Add operation depends on the allowance of the underlying data source.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/dataentry-overview.html">online documentation</a></p>
