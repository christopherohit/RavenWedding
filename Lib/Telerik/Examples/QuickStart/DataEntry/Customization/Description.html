RadDataEntry provides a flexible API which allows you to easily customize the behavior and appearance of the component. You can change the properties of all components contained in RadDataEntry by using the ItemInitialized event. Use the EditorInitializing event to replace the default editor with one of your choice. For example, if you have a data field labeled "Salary", you can place a RadMaskedEditBox instance. Furthermore, you can have to parse the data provided by the custom editor on the Parse event of the RadDataEntry binding and process this parsed data to the underlying object.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/dataentry-properties-events-and-attributes.html">online documentation</a></p>
