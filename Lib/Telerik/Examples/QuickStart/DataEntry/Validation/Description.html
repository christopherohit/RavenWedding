This example illustrates the validation capabilities of RadDataEntry and shows you how you can implement your custom validation logic. RadDataEntry supports the default ErrorProvider as well as a custom panel which lists all the errors in the currently edited object. When there is an error, you can prevent the end-user from going to the next editor, object, or close the form by cancelling the ValidatingItem event.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/dataentry-validation.html">online documentation</a></p>
