The Telerik <strong>RadWaitingBar</strong> control is designed to let the user know that a long-running application is proceeding at an indeterminate length.

Instead, it smoothly animates a block across a rectangle image that appears in the background as long as the operation continues.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/track-and-status-controls-waitingbar-overview.html">online documentation</a></p>
