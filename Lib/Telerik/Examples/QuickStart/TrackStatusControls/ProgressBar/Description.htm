<b>RadProgressBar</b> is a themeable progress bar control designed to display progress information during a long-running operation. In addition to using the Telerik Presentation Framework for theming, it offers other advantages over the standard Windows Forms ProgressBar control, such as support for displaying text and images within the body of the progress bar; Dashed and cross-hatched indicator styles; Support for displaying two values on a single progress bar (the second value is indicated by a change in shade in the unfilled portion of the Telerik <b>RadProgressBar</b>).<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/track-and-status-controls-progressbar-overview.html">online documentation</a></p>
