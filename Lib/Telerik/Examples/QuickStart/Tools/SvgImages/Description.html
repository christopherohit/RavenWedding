This example demonstrates the difference in scaling when using raster images and vector images.

You can apply SVG image on a control just by using the SvgImage property that is integrated in LightVisualElement and ImagePrimitive.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/winforms/telerik-presentation-framework/vector-images-support">online documentation</a></p>
