Using <b>References</b> you can create a more structured and easy to navigate document. In this way, you will no only enrich its content, but also improve its readability. <b>Footnotes</b> and <b>endnotes</b> are particularity useful when remarks have to be added to the document, but inserting them inline would interrupt the natural flow of thought. The <b>Citations and Bibliography</b> functionality is also used in a similar manner in scenarios such as when creating a thesis, a dissertation or another document that requires sources of information to be quoted. The feature is enhanced by the presence of predefined styles, which are designed especially for this purpose: APA, ISO690 and Harvard-Angila. <p>You can find additional information on this topic in the following articles <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/richtexteditor-features-references-footnotes-and-endnotes.html">footnotes and endnotes</a>, <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/richtexteditor-features-references-biliographic-references.html">bibliographic references</a> and <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/richtexteditor-features-references-cross-reference.html">cross reference</a> articles</p>
