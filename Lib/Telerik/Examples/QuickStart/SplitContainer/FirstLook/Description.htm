The Telerik <b>SplitContainer</b> is a complicated layout control which allows you to add many container panels to a form, separated by splitter(s). It is very handy for creating complex user interfaces where a selection in one panel determines what objects are shown in another panel. The splitter makes it very easy for users to resize the panels to fit their personal liking.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/splitcontainer-overview.html">online documentation</a></p>
