RadSplitContainer's splitters allow end-user to easily collapse a panel that is currently not needed and expand it at a later stage. This expand/collapse operation can occur on double-click of the splitter. Alternatively, the splitter can display expand/collapse buttons that the end-user can click to control
the expand/collapse behavior of the panels including direction to which the panels should collapse.
