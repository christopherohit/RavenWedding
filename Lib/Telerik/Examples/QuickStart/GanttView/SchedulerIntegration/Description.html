RadGanttView provides seamless integration with another task managment component - RadScheduler. By using both components combined, you can easily take a snapshot of your workflow. Any task change in one of the linked components is directly reflected into the other. RadGanttView automatically detects all appointments' settings, so you can easily format it depending on the appointments' resources or backgrounds.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/ganttview-integration.html">online documentation</a></p>
