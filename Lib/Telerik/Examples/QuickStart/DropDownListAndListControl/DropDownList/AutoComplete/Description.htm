<b>RadDropDownList</b> has full autocomplete support - as soon as the user starts typing, the combobox selects or fills-in the first matching entry from the list. The different autocomplete modes can be set through the <b>AutoCompleteMode</b> property and they are: * In <i>Suggest</i> mode the first item that starts with the entered text is automatically selected in the dropdown area. * In <i>Append</i> mode the first item that starts with the text is automatically appended in the text area, but the drop down area does not appear. * In <i>SuggestAppend</i> mode both of the above happen simultaneously. Autocomplete mode can be case-sensitive or case-insensitive.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/dropdown-and-listcontrol-dropdownlist-autocompleate.html">online documentation</a></p>
