<b>RadDropDownList </b>supports automatic sorting, based on the <i>Sorted</i> property of the control - simply set it to <i>true</i> to sort in ascending order, or deactivate it to restore the initial ordering of the ItemCollection. Sorting may be case-sensitive or case-insensitive. Capital letters are displayed first in the former case.
