<i>RadCheckedDropDownList</i> allows the end-user to select multiple items from a checked drop-down list. The selected items appear as tokens in the editor part which allows the end-user to easily delete them either by the keyboard or by the mouse clicking the close button. RadCheckedDropDownList also accepts input from its editor part providing auto-complete behavior, thus making the process of entering data a breeze.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/dropdown-and-listcontrol-checkedropdownlist.html">online documentation</a></p>
