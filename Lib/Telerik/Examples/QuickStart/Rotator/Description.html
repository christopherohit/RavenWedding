<strong>RadRotator</strong> is a multipurpose component for content rotation. It can rotate any static or dynamic content - even complete web-pages with Flash, windowed objects, etc. It is a RadItem-driven control, which means that you can rotate any Telerik RadElement (RadTextBox, RadButton, RadComboBox, etc.) enabling you to introduce personalized features to your Windows Forms application. <p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/rotator-overview.html">online documentation</a></p>
