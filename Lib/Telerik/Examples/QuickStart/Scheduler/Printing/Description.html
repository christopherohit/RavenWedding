You can use the built-in printing functionality of RadScheduler to print its data. This example demostrates how to directly print RadScheduler, show the RadPrintPreviewDialog or show the Print settings dialog. The printing support of RadScheduler is capable of printing four different print styles, similar to the Outlook ones: DailyStyle, WeeklyStyle, MonthlyStyle, DetailsStyle. In all these modes you can add to your pages an area for handwritten notes or a date header with a small calendar that shows the busy days. You can set page headers, page footers, watermarks and paper size settings.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/scheduler-print-support.html">online documentation</a></p>
