Mapping of scheduler properties to data source properties is easy with <b>RadScheduler</b> through the <i>AppointmentMappingInfo</i> and <i>ResourceMappingInfo</i> classes. With these strongly typed <i>MappingInfo</i> classes, all you have to do is set the names of your data source fields.<b>RadScheduler</b> also permits not only basic, but advanced properties to be saved in the data source, such as assigned resources and recurrence rules (the recurrence rules are saved as an iCal formatted string). <strong>RadScheduler</strong> also allows you to bind to custom object. This example demonstrates how to easily bind <b>RadScheluder</b> to DataSet and Business objects by using the provided SchedulerBindingDataSource, although we are not limited to these.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/scheduler-data-binding-introduction.html">online documentation</a></p>
