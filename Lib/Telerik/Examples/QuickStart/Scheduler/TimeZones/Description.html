<p>This example demonstrates the behavior of TimeZones in the different views of the Scheduler. Selecting a Time Zone and clicking <strong>Apply Time Zone</strong> will change the appointments based on the UTC offset for that Time Zone.</p><p>If it becomes necessary to display <em>multiple</em> Time Zones at once, RadScheduler supports this as well (in Day, Week, WorkWeek views). Selecting a Time Zone and clicking <strong>Add Time Zone</strong> will add an additional Time Zone ruler to the selected view.</p><p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/scheduler-views-time-zones.html">online documentation</a></p>
