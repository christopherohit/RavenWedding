<b>Updated</b>
EditAppointmentDialog now provides UI for selecting multiple resources per appointment. In certain cases (e.g. unbound mode), the Resource RadDropDownList is replaced with a RadCheckedDropDownList. Otherwise, the default drop down with single selection for resources is shown.

<p>Telerik <b>RadScheduler</b> is a highly-customizable appointment presentation component that offers rich Outlook®-style functionality. When used with <b>RadReminder</b> and <b>RadDesktopAlert</b> you can add rich scheduling UI to any Windows Forms application and enjoy a lightweight yet highly customizable component.
