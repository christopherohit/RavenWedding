RadPivotGrid for WinForms takes large chunks of data and summarizes it in a human readable way with the help of aggregates and field descriptors. The end-user can easily achieve the exact aggregated view of the dataset that would best suit their needs by using a simple drag and drop  operation over the boxes of the field descriptors and the aggregates. RadPivotGrid can also sort the data and display subtotals and grandtotals at the end or at the beginning of the summarized data. The built-in UI virtualization support available in RadGridView, allows the PivotGrid to easily handle large datasets while delivering top performance and low memory footprint in the most demanding scenarios. As a control based on the Telerik Presentation Framework, RadPivotGrid also brings support for themes that you can quickly personalize with the help of the Visual Style Builder.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/pivotgrid-overview.html">online documentation</a></p>
