RadPivotFieldList is a control which provides functionality similar to the PivotTable Field List panel in MS Excel. By using RadPivotFieldList, the end-user can adjust the way of representing aggregated data in RadPivotGrid by modifying the column/row group descriptions, the aggregate descriptions or the report filters. The end-users can do this by dragging fields across the four list boxes in RadPivotFieldList or by reordering the items in a single list.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/pivotgrid-radpivotfieldlist.html">online documentation</a></p>
