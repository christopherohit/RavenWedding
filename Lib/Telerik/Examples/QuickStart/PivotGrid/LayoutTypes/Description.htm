RadPivotGrid supports two types of layouts – Tabular and Compact. The Tabular layout displays each field in a separate box  – for row descriptors in a separate column, and for column descriptors in a separate row. The compact layout nests the field descriptors in one common box to optimize space which can be useful in any scenario which uses a large number of fields.
