<strong>RadTreeView</strong> supports drag-and-drop functionality for tree nodes. To enable this mode you need to mark the instance of <strong>RadTreeView</strong> with the <i>AllowDragDrop="True"</i> attribute and you willl be able to drag and drop tree-nodes. A visual indicator shows the position of where the node will be dropped (above, below, within). When <strong>RadTreeView</strong> detects a valid drag-and-drop operation (the selected node is dropped onto another node) it generates an event you can use to perform a specific action, by fetching both the source and destination drag/drop nodes.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/treeview-drag-and-drop-enabling-drag-and-drop.html">online documentation</a></p>
