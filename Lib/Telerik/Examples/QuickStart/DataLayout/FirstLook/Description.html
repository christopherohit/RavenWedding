RadDataLayout provides an easy way to display and edit arbitrary business objects by generating editors inside a RadLayoutControl. The built-in editors are generated by default, so that you can achieve a fully operational CRUD support with a single line of code by simply binding to the business object or to a collection of objects. In addition, you can take full advantage of the features RadLayoutControl provides, such as runtime layout modifications, persisting the current layout and keeping the layout consistent while the form is resized.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/datalayout-overview.html">online documentation</a></p>.
