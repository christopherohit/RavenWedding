When in Strip mode, <b>RadPageView</b> provides extended automatic scrolling and overflow support, which is very handy when there are more tabs than can be displayed on the estate. Use the arrow buttons for left and right navigation, or navigate to the needed tab by using the ItemList overflow menu which lists all available tabs. All buttons are controlled through the <i>RadPageViewStripElement.StripButtons</i> property.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/pageview-stripview-scrolling-and-overflow.html">online documentation</a></p>
