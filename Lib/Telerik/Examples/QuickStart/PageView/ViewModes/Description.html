This example shows the three different navigation modes that RadPageView supports, and which can be switched between through a single property. Each implements a different layout strategy, making it unique in its presentation:<ul><li><i>StripView</i> is essentially a TabStrip</li><li><i>OutlookView</i> resembles Outlook's NavPane </li><li><i>StackView</i> is a ListBar.</li></ul>
