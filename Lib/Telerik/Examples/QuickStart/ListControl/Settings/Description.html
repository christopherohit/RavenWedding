<b>RadListControl</b> is a themable listbox control that displays a list of items which you can select. It exposes two multi-selection modes: MultiSimple and MultiExtened. While the former selects and deselects items independently one of another, the latter requires the user to hold the Ctrl key in order to select multiple items.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/dropdown-and-listcontrol-listcontrol-features.html">online documentation</a></p>
