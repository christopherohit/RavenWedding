<b>PdfStreamWriter</b> functionality provides option for exporting PDF files with unmatched performance and minimized memory footprint. The key for the memory and performance efficiency is that when manipulating PDF files (e.g. reading, writing, splitting or merging pages, changing content) the action is done without creating PDF document model in the memory but generating the PDF content directly to a stream. Moreover, existing pages content is written unmodified which guarantees preserving the original data. The current example demonstrates how to easily manipulate PDF files using PdfStreamWriter.
