This example demonstrates the functionality of the filtering row. The available filter functions are <i>Equals, Starts with, Ends with, Contains, Less than, Greater than,</i> etc. The logical operation applied between the individual filters are <i>AND </i>- a row will appear in the result set if it satisfies all cell filter conditions; <i>OR </i>- a row will appear in the result set if it satisfies at least one cell filter condition, and <i>None </i>- no filtering will be applied.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/gridview-filtering-basic-filtering.html">online documentation</a></p>
