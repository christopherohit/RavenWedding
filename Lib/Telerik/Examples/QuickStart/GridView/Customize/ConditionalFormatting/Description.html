For enhanced readability and usability of the displayed data, <b>RadGridView</b> enables users to apply <i>conditional formatting</i> to grid elements. In addition to using the extended event-based cell presentation mechanism, they can achieve advanced graphical appearance by only modifying the visual properties of the cells. Data is formatted based on user-specified rules with the help of the intuitive MS Excel-like Conditional Formatting dialog, which is called upon right-clicking anywhere in the GridView.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/gridview-rows-conditional-formatting-rows.html">online documentation</a></p>
