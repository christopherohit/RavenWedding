The paging support of RadGridView allows your end-users to easily check data page by page without scrolling up and down in a grid containing thousands of records. By default, when RadGridView is grouped, the groups are paged instead of the individual item. This example demonstrates the behavior of RadGridView when paging happens before grouping and vice versa.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/gridview-paging-overview.html">online documentation</a></p>
