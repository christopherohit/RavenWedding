A computed column is identified by an expression. The expression calculates a value by combining multiple columns of the same table using operators. You can use simple arithmetic operators like + and * as well as logical operators like = and &lt;. Boolean operators (AND, OR, NOT) are allowed, as well as more complex operators like IN, LIKE, and % (modulus). Operators take the usual precedence that you can alter using parentheses at will. The following strings represent some feasible expressions for computed columns: <i>Country = 'USA' | Year &gt;= 1999 And LastName LIKE 'A%' | Price * 0.2 + Freight. </i>Column names can be used as keywords and must be unquoted. Names, instead, must always be single-quoted. Dates should be bracketed by the pound (#) character: <i>HireDate &gt; #2-1-2002#. </i><p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/gridview-expressioneditor-overview.html">online documentation</a></p>
