The Column Chooser is a form which can be used to show/hide available columns in <strong>RadGridView.</strong> It is invoked by right-clicking on any column header and selecting Column Chooser from the context menu. Columns can be dragged and dropped from the control to the Column Chooser and vice versa. Anytime a column is removed from <strong>RadGridView,</strong> it appears in the Column Chooser.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/gridview-columns-working-with-column-chooser.html">online documentation</a></p>
