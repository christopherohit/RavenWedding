This example demonstrates the group level summary capability of the RadGridView. In order to enable group summaries, add <strong>GridViewSummaryRowItems</strong> to one of the following collections: <strong>GridViewTemplate.SummaryRowGroupHeaders, GridViewTemplate.SummaryRowsTop</strong> or <strong>GridViewTemplate.SummaryRowsBottom.</strong> In each <strong>GridViewSummaryRowItem,</strong> add a <strong>GridViewSummaryItem</strong> object for each summary you need. Initialize them by setting their <strong>FieldName</strong> property to the corresponding column and <strong>Function</strong> to the desired function. You can also control the text formatting by changing the <strong>FormatString.</strong>
