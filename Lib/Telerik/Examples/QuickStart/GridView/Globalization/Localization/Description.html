This example shows how to localize the <strong>RadGridView.</strong> The <i>MyGermanRadGridLocalizationProvider</i> descendant of the <strong>RadGridLocalizationSettings</strong> class, which appears in the Form1.cs class, holds the text values used in the UI. Note the overriden <strong>GetLocalizedString(string id)</strong> method, which includes translations for the label and user messages. If a translation is not provided for a particular text value, the default value will be returned. The custom localization provider is then set to the current provider in the last line of the constructor of the form. The localization provider is global and needs to be reset to its original value if other instances of <strong>RadGridView</strong> need to be shown in a different language.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/gridview-localization.html">online documentation</a></p>
