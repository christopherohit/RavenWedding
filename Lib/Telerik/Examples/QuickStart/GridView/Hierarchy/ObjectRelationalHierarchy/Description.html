<p>The <b>Object-relational hierarchy</b> mode of <i>RadGridView</i> allows the grid to be bound to data/business objects and entities, as well as object relational mapping frameworks, such as Telerik’s <b>OpenAccess ORM</b> and Entity Framework.</p><p>The approach is extremely simple – once you have created your model, simply set is as the GridView’s DataSource and set the <b>AutoGenerateHierarchy</b> property to true; <i>RadGridView</i>  will automatically take care of the rest.</p><p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/gridview-hierarchical-grid-object-relational-hierarchy-mode.html">online documentation</a></p>
