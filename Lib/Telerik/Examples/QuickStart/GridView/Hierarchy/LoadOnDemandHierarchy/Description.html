<p>The <b>Event-based hierarchy</b> allows you to bind ChildRows on demand, i.e. at the time when they are accessed (a.k.a. <b>Lazy Loading</b>). Since only the topmost level of hierarchy level is loaded at a time, this approach provides better performance and is very handy when the data set is very large, when presenting custom data, and/or when services are used to fetch the data. Review the source code for more information on the implementation.</p><p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/gridview-hierarchical-grid-load-on-demand-hierarchy.html">online documentation</a></p>
