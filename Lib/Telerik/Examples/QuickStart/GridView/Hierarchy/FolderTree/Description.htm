This example shows the self-referencing hierarchy model of Telerik RadGridView. It allows you to build multiple levels of hierarchy from a single table in the data source by specifying relations inside the same table.  You do not need to create separate templates for each child level - one relation is sufficient to define the hierarchy.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/gridview-hierarchical-grid-self-referencing-hierarchy.html">online documentation</a></p>
