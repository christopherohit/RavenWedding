The built-in search row in <strong>RadGridView</strong> provides an easy-to-use way for the end-users to search for a particular string in the grid. Upon writing in the search text field, the end user gets immediate visual feedback from <strong>RadGridView</strong> if the visible cells on the screen are matching the search criteria. Furthermore, upon clicking the next/prev button or hitting <strong>Enter</strong>/<strong>Shift+Enter</strong>, the end user will be navigated through the cells of interest. The search process will be asynchronous ensuring smooth application experience while the search process takes place. The <strong>DeferredSearch</strong> property indicates whether the grid control will wait until the Enter key is pressed before a new search operation is started.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/gridview-rows-search-row.html">online documentation</a></p>
