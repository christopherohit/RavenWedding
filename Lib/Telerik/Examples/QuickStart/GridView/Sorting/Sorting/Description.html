Three sorting directions are supported by <strong>RadGridView</strong>: <i>Ascending, Descending,</i> and <i>None.</i> As in Excel, sorting is allied by clicking on the column header text. This example demonstrates how data can be sorted programmatically by using the <b>GridSortExpression</b> class that provides the sorting options for <strong>RadGridView</strong> by using the <b>SortExpressions</b> collection of the <b>GridTableView</b> class, and how to set the two different sorting modes - single or multi-column sorting.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/gridview-sorting-basic-sorting.html">online documentation</a></p>
