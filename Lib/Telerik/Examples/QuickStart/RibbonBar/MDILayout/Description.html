The Telerik <strong>RadRibbonBar</strong> supports MDI functionality. When the RibbonBar form has a child form, it shows special controls for common actions on the child form - <i>Restore</i>, <i>Minimize</i> and <i>Close.</i> It automatically manages child forms into main form layout. The main benefit of the MDI control is that it can be used completely automatically without writing a single line of code.
