The Line Series in this example demonstrates how the ChartView can handle typical business scenarios where real-time process monitoring is required. To illustrate this, the chart is set to auto refresh every 1 millisecond with new data. For more demanding scenarios, you can use the FastLineSeries, which delivers even better performance in terms of painting.
