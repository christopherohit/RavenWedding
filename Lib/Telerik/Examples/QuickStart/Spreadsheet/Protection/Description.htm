In this example <b>RadSpreadsheet’s</b> protection feature makes particular regions of cells read-only. The balance sheet template lets you edit only the assets and liabilities amounts, i.e. the cells with background color. To change the contents of the rest of the cells, you need to remove the sheet protection first. Feel free to get rid of the current protection (the password is <i>telerik</i>) and set your own password!
