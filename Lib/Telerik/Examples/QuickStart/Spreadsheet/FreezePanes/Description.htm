Dealing with worksheets with many rows and columns may be hard, especially when you scroll away from the headers that give meaning to the data in the cells. In such cases <b>RadSpreadsheet</b> allows you to pin multiple rows and/or columns to the top-left of the worksheet. Use the buttons to freeze and unfreeze multiple rows and columns.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/winforms/spreadsheet/features/freeze-panes">online documentation</a></p>
