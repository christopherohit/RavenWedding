Data Validation in <b>RadSpreadsheet</b> allows you to restrict the user input to certain constraints. For example, allow entering of positive whole numbers only or restrict the possible values to a specific list. There are several rules you could use like Whole number, Decimal, List, Date, Time, Text length and Custom rule. The functionality also allows you to visualize where the rules are not satisfied.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/devtools/winforms/spreadsheet/features/data-validation">online documentation</a></p>
