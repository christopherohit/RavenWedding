This example demonstrates the dynamic creation of <strong>ToolWindow</strong> instances and the AutoHide feature of RadDock. RadDock provides a container that holds dockable windows. This container can fill the entire client area of the form, or can be limited to any rectangular area you choose to manage. You can mix a docking implementation with traditional Windows Forms or Telerik RadControls on the same form.<br />In this example seven <strong>ToolWindow</strong>(s) are created and the last four are unpinned/hidden. There are four sides (left, top, right, bottom) that accept the hidden windows. When the pin button is clicked on a window that is docked, it is removed from the dock layout, and a tab appears on the proper side of the docking area. When you pass through an unpinned toolwindow, it shows and hides automatically when the mouse moves over the tab and leaves the toolwindow.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/dock-mdi-mode-automatic-mdi-form-handling.html">online documentation</a></p>
