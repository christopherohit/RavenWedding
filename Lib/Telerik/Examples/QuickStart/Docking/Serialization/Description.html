This example demonstrates <strong>RadDock</strong>'s serialization and deserialization functionality. Several ToolWindows are already created and docked for the purpose of the example. Use <strong>Save</strong> from the menu to serialize the RadDock structure: <i>dockingManager1.SaveXML(FileName);</i><br />or use <strong>Load</strong> to load the RadDock structure: <i>dockingManager1.LoadXML(FileName);</i><br />Also, you can reset the dockManager by calling: <i>dockingManager1.Reset();</i><p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/dock-loading-and-saving-layouts.html">online documentation</a></p>
