Telerik <strong>RadDock</strong> ensures you have complete support of the latest user interface standards. You get <strong>ToolWindow</strong> functionality with horizontal and vertical splits, docked and floating ToolWindows, nested ToolWindows, autohiding ToolWindows, pinned ToolWindows, tabbed ToolWindows, and easy navigation with <strong>Ctrl+Tab</strong> support. Plus, the docking system has full drag-and-drop support including the docking compass and docking hints for visual feedback.<br />In this example, <strong>ProgrammableToolWnd</strong> inherits from <strong>ToolWindow</strong>. The two <strong>ProgrammableToolWnd</strong> instances are created and each provides five buttons for managing its state. You may derive from the ToolWindow class in order to 
use these five buttons and their functionality.<p>You can find additional information on this topic in our <a href="http://www.telerik.com/help/winforms/dock-object-model-tracking-the-activewindow.html">online documentation</a></p>
