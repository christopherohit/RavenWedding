This example demonstrates how the RadDock control can be used to create applications with an interface similar to Visual Studio 2012. RadDock provides a container which holds dockable windows and also provides a container for opening and editing multiple documents at once. The windows and the documents can be rearranged in a way which feels most comfortable for the end user. Using the <i>Pinned Tabs</i> feature and opening a document in the <i>Preview Tab</i> makes managing multiple documents even more easy. In addition, using the built-in VisualStudio2012Light theme brings a familiar look and feel to your applications.
